subqueries:

 - can use them both in FROM and WHERE, e.g.

EXPLAIN VERBOSE SELECT unique1
FROM tenk1 t
WHERE t.ten < ALL (SELECT o.ten FROM onek o WHERE o.four = t.four);

 - Q: what are the rules for outer query being able to reference tables/columns that are referenced inside the subquery, or subquery accessing tables/columns in the outer query?
