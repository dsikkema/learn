The structure of this repository is that each folder represents hands on tutorials or mini-projects I've run through for a particular topic. 

My rule is that I use LLMs (namely Claude) heavily to generate _the tutorials themselves_, which includes code, but I don't copy/paste the code from Claude or any other source. I hand-type it, giving me the opportunity to paraphrase the code and go in different directions. For example, nothing about the bizarro EditableThought component in next-react-tailwind/ came directly from Claude, but it showed me examples of components that I could look at while creating different templates to do different things.

This also means that I don't use Cursor's AI features or AI-autocomplete for any of this code. I do use Cursor, but I disable all these features when in this project. I have used the Chat mode in order to generate tutorials before but not to write any code, and nowadays I get my tutorials from the web interface instead (because of its support for tree-structured conversations and to avoid hitting Cursor usage limits).

`external_content/` is the only place I've put content I've copied from LLMs or other people.
